Documentation in social-care work is essential. Hours must be noted and times must be settled with the social welfare office. Clients' progress in many areas of life must be documented and development plans written. Maybe you also want to write down some notes for yourself and the duty roster must be written or a shift must be swapped.

All that combined in one application is the Goal of our App.

The basic futures are already implemented and more to come!
